## 🧩 What is Attachment Style?

Attachment style refers to our patterns of behavior and emotion in close relationships. The ECR scale measures two main dimensions:

| Dimension | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Anxiety** | Degree of fear about being abandoned |
| **Avoidance** | Tendency to keep distance from others |

Based on these two dimensions, people fall into four attachment types:

| Type | Characteristics |
|------|-----------------|
| **Secure** | Enjoys closeness, trusts partner |
| **Anxious** | Desires closeness, fears abandonment |
| **Avoidant** | Independent, doesn't rely on others |
| **Fearful** | Desires closeness but fears getting hurt |

## 📚 About the ECR Scale

The ECR (Experiences in Close Relationships) scale used in this program was developed by psychologists Fraley, Waller, and Brennan in 2000. It is a widely-used psychological measurement tool in attachment research.
